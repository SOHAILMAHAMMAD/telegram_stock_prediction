# Telegram Stock Prediction

This project demonstrates how to scrape data from Telegram channels related to stock market discussions, preprocess the data, and use machine learning to predict stock market trends based on the sentiment of messages.

## Project Overview

1. **Scraping Data**: We use the Telethon library to scrape messages from a specified Telegram channel. Only messages that contain specific keywords related to stocks and the market (such as 'stock', 'market', 'price') are collected.
2. **Preprocessing**: The messages are preprocessed to extract relevant features, such as sentiment and message length. Sentiment is calculated using the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, which provides a sentiment score for each message.
3. **Prediction Model**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained using the extracted features to predict stock market trends. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
4. **Integration and Execution**: The entire process is integrated into a script that scrapes data, processes it, and trains the model in one flow.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-stock-prediction.git
cd telegram-stock-prediction

2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have pip installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can install the required libraries manually by running:

pip install telethon pandas scikit-learn nltk

3.Set Up Telegram API
To scrape data from Telegram, you need to create an app on Telegram's developer portal and obtain your api_id and api_hash. Follow these steps:

Go to Telegram's developer portal.
Log in with your phone number and create a new application to get your api_id and api_hash.
Keep these credentials secure and add them to the scraper_and_model.py file in the following sections:

api_id = 'your_api_id'      # Replace with your Telegram API ID
api_hash = 'your_api_hash'  # Replace with your Telegram API Hash
channel_username = 'your_channel_username'  # Replace with the username of the channel you want to scrape

4. Run the Script
Once the dependencies are installed and the credentials are set, you can run the scraper_and_model.py script to scrape data from Telegram, preprocess it, and train the prediction model.

Run the script using:

python scraper_and_model.py


5. Run the Jupyter Notebook (Optional)
Alternatively, you can run the demo_notebook.ipynb notebook to interactively perform the scraping, preprocessing, and model training steps. This notebook provides a step-by-step demonstration of how the process works.

To open the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter installed. If you don't have it, install it using:

pip install notebook

Once installed, you can open the notebook by running:

bash


jupyter notebook demo_notebook.ipynb


This will launch Jupyter in your browser. You can then run the cells to scrape data, preprocess it, and train the model interactively.

File Descriptions
scraper_and_model.py: Contains the main Python script for scraping data from Telegram, preprocessing it, training the machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.
requirements.txt: Lists the required libraries for the project.
demo_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the entire process: scraping, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
README.md: This file, containing detailed setup instructions and usage information.
Model Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive cases.
